    Sidra Privacy Policy
Last updated: [DATE]

Sidra (“we”, “us”, “our”) is an Islamic habit and productivity app. This Privacy Policy explains what information Sidra collects, how it is used, and your choices.

1) Summary
	•	Sidra is designed to work primarily offline.
	•	Most of your data (tasks, reflections, XP, streaks, settings) is stored locally on your device.
	•	Sidra may use third-party services to:
	•	show web content you open (e.g., Contact form, Donate page)
	•	collect crash/error diagnostics (if enabled)

2) Information we collect

A) Data you enter in the app (stored locally)

Sidra may store the following on your device:
	•	Task completion history (daily tasks, repeats)
	•	Reflections/journal entries you type
	•	XP, streaks, badges, and reward progress
	•	Notification preferences (quiet hours, nudge intensity)
	•	App preferences and internal flags

This data is stored locally using device storage (e.g., AsyncStorage/MMKV depending on your build).

B) Device and app diagnostics (optional)

If crash/error reporting is enabled in your build, Sidra may collect diagnostic information such as:
	•	app version/build, device OS version
	•	crash logs and error traces
	•	anonymized identifiers used for debugging stability issues

Sidra uses Sentry for crash/error monitoring when configured.

C) Data submitted through Contact Us (Google Forms)

If you use the in-app “Contact Us” form, your submission is handled by Google Forms. The information you enter (and any prefilled diagnostics like app version/timezone) is sent to the form owner (us). Google’s own privacy practices apply when using Google Forms.

D) Donation/support links (Buy Me a Coffee)

If you tap “Support Sidra,” Sidra may open a web page inside the app (WebView) or in your browser. Any information you provide on those pages is handled by the relevant website (e.g., Buy Me a Coffee) under their privacy policy.

E) Remote configuration

Sidra may fetch a small remote configuration file (for example, to update support links, donate link, banners, or content patches). This request may reveal your IP address to the hosting provider (standard for any internet request). Sidra caches the configuration locally to reduce network usage.

3) How we use information

We use information to:
	•	run core features (tasks, XP, streaks, rewards)
	•	show reminders/notifications you enable
	•	improve stability and performance (diagnostics/crash reports)
	•	respond to your support requests

We do not sell your personal data.

4) Sharing of information

Sidra may share information only in these cases:
	•	With service providers you directly use via the app (e.g., Google Forms for Contact Us, Sentry for crash diagnostics, web pages for donations)
	•	If required by law

5) Data retention
	•	Local app data stays on your device until you delete it (by uninstalling the app or clearing storage).
	•	Support form submissions and crash diagnostics are retained by the relevant provider (Google/Sentry) according to their retention policies and our account settings.

6) Your choices

You can:
	•	Disable notifications at the OS level or in Sidra settings.
	•	Choose whether to submit support requests via the form.
	•	Uninstall the app to remove locally stored data.

If you want us to delete a support submission you sent, contact us at: islamicappsdeveloper@gmail.com with the details of your message.

7) Security

We take reasonable steps to protect data. However, no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure. Please avoid entering highly sensitive personal data into reflections.

8) Children’s privacy

Sidra is not intended to knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has submitted personal information through the Contact Us form, contact us and we will take appropriate steps.

9) Changes to this policy

We may update this policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date will reflect changes.
